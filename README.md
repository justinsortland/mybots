# Assignment 6 - Random Snake

In this assignment, I modified solution.py so that it generated a snake with:
1. Random number of links/cubes
2. Random number of sensor neurons, where cubes with sensor neurons are denoted by a green coloring, whereas cubes without sensors neurons are denoted by a blue coloring
3. Random number of motor neurons 

In order to run one random simulation, run the following command:
```
python search.py
```

```
python3 search.py
```
